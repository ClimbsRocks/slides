# Teaching Materials

This repo is simply a backup of the teaching materials I've built using reveal.js and slides.com. 

## Where to Find
In pretty format, all these slides are available at: 
https://slides.com/climbsrocks

## Can I Use These Materials?
Yes, please!
And feel free to submit ideas to make them even better. 
Just make sure to give proper credit and blame back to the source :)

## Contributing
Edit the html source code here! And then I'll update that in the slides.com decks.
